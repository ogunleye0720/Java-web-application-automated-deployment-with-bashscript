### INTRODUCTION
<p>As organizations embark on their digital transformation journeys, they are actively seeking pathways to rejuvenate, innovate, and align their application ecosystems with the cutting-edge technologies offered by major public cloud giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. The lift and shift strategy has emerged as a practical and efficient approach for migrating applications to the cloud, enabling organizations to harness the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and cost-effective solutions, offered by cloud platforms.</p>

<p>This journey of migration becomes even more crucial when dealing with complex and interconnected systems, such as a Java Spring Boot web application powered by Tomcat, RabbitMQ, Memcached, and MySQL. These technologies are the backbone of many enterprise-grade applications, and migrating them seamlessly to a cloud environment requires careful planning, execution, and coordination</p>.
